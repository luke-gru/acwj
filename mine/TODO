TODO
====

Functional
----------
* Get passing more than 6 arguments to functions working
* Typechecking
* Arrays as function parameters
* Function prototypes
* User-defined types
* Type aliases
* Put string literals in read-only memory
* Get array variables to decay to a pointer to their first element
* Allow extern declarations, example: for `errno` to allow checking this value
when compiling with mylib.c

Optimizations
-------------
* Omit frame pointer optimization
* Register optimizations

Would Be Nice
-------------
* Output debug information during compilation
