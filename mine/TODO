TODO
====

Functional
----------
* Allow arrays as function parameters
* Put string literals in read-only memory
* Get array variables to decay to a pointer to their first element
* Get extern functions working
* Get Composite member access working with mixed -> and .
* Try to compile compiler itself

Optimizations
-------------
* Omit the frame pointer as micro-optimization, use stack pointer offsets instead
* Various register optimizations

Would Be Nice
-------------
* Output debug information during compilation
