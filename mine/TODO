TODO
====

Functional
----------
* Allow arrays as function parameters
* Put string literals in read-only memory
* Get Composite member access working with mixed -> and .
* Try to compile compiler itself
* Add static local variables, only initialized during first call to function
* Allow ++ and -- operators after member access, not just identifiers
* Allow expression lists (expr1, expr2)
* Get (void)0; to parse (useful for preprocessor)
* Get `1-1` working as intended, right now `-` right before a digit is scanned
as part of the INTLIT
* Allow assignment declaration as init value in `for` stmt `for (int i = 0;;`)
* Get local struct declarations working
* Implement goto and labels

Optimizations
-------------
* Omit the frame pointer as micro-optimization, use stack pointer offsets instead
* Various register optimizations

Would Be Nice
-------------
* Output debug information during compilation
